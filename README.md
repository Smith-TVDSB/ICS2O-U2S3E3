# 2-3 Exercise 2

## The assignment
Edit the file named "student.py".  
You should only use one print statement, otherwise use the input statement for user instructions.  
  
Create a program that lets the user enter their mark as a percentage. The program then displays their mark as a letter grade.
  
| Letter Grade | Percent  |  
|--------------|----------|  
|       A      |   >80%   |  
|       B      |  70-79%  |
|       C      |  60-69%  |
|       D      |  50-59%  |
|       F      |   <50%   |
